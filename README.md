# Prodigy Infotech Data Science Project<br>
## Project Overview<br>
This project is part of an internship at Prodigy Infotech. It involves using various machine learning models to 
predict outcomes based on a dataset. The primary focus is on training and evaluating models to understand their performance.<br>

## Project Structure<BR>
### Data Loading and Exploration:<br>
-Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the data structure and summary statistics.<br>

## Data Preprocessing:
-Handle missing values.<br>
-Encode categorical variables.<br>
-Feature Engineering.<br>
-Split the data into training and testing sets.<br>

## Model Training and Evaluation:<br>
-Train machine learning models using Decision Tree<br>
-Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.<br>

## Hyperparameter Tuning:<br>
-Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for selected models to optimize their performance.<br>

## Visualization:<br>
-Generate visualizations to compare model performance.<br>
-Plot ROC curves for the models.<br>

## Conclusion:<br>
Summarize findings and suggest the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.<br>

## Results:<br>
-The notebook includes performance metrics and visualizations for each model.<br>
-Hyperparameter tuning results are presented for selected models.<br>
-The best-performing model is identified based on evaluation metrics.<br>
